### Commit Overview
Reviewed the `registeruser.php` script and documented its functionality, security measures, and how the registration process works. 

### Details of the Review
1. **CSRF Token Handling:**
   - The script includes `CSRFTokenHandler` to manage CSRF tokens, enhancing security by protecting against CSRF attacks.
   - CSRF tokens are generated for each session and validated during form submission.

2. **Security Level Configuration:**
   - The script configures various security measures based on the security level set in the session.
   - Security levels range from 0 (insecure) to 5 (secure), with different features enabled such as JavaScript validation, HTML controls, method tampering protection, and output encoding.

3. **Form Submission Handling:**
   - The script checks if the registration form has been submitted by looking for the `register-php-submit-button` parameter.
   - Depending on the security level, it processes form data securely, including handling the username, password, confirm password, signature, and CSRF token.
   - It validates inputs and interacts with the database to create a new user.

4. **HTML Form:**
   - The registration form includes fields for username, password, confirm password, and signature.
   - JavaScript and HTML controls are conditionally enabled based on the security level to ensure secure input handling.

5. **Detailed Explanation of the Script:**
   - **CSRF Token Handling:** The script initializes and uses the `CSRFTokenHandler` class to manage CSRF tokens, ensuring each form submission includes a valid CSRF token.
   - **Security Level Configuration:** Depending on the session's security level, different security features are enabled or disabled to demonstrate various security practices.
   - **Form Submission Handling:** The script processes the form submission by securely handling input data and interacting with the database to register a new user.
   - **HTML Form:** The form is designed with fields for user input and includes hidden inputs for CSRF token and other necessary parameters.
