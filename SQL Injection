Hey folks, check out these awesome SQL injection experiments I just did on Mutillidae:

#feat: Explored SQL Injection on Mutillidae Dashboard

Implemented SQL injection techniques to test security vulnerabilities on the Mutillidae dashboard login/registration page. Successfully extracted user information from the database by bypassing input validations. Explored various injection payloads to understand the scope of potential vulnerabilities and their impact.

Documentation and findings added to our cybersecurity research repository.


#feat: Successfully Bypassed Authentication via SQL Injection

Implemented SQL injection on Mutillidae's login page to bypass authentication. Utilized the classic payload ' or '1=1 to gain unauthorized access by circumventing the login checks.

Demonstrated the critical vulnerability and emphasized the importance of robust input validation and secure coding practices. 

Detailed findings documented for further analysis and mitigation strategies in our cybersecurity repository.
